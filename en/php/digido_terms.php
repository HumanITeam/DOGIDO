User agreement and terms of service
DONATION 
Users on DigiDo are allowed to massively give away products. Over a batch of ten products, the 
condition is no more supported by us, only the number of items sent..
The delivery of donated products is supported by DigiDo. The two parties must provide their real 
contact and address. The delivery will be carried on in the 30 days following the order.
Offers are saved in our database for 40 days. If a client complains about an inaccurate donation during this time, the donor’s account can be deleted.
In case of problems with the products or the delivery, DigiDo is never responsible.
A donation can’t lead to a marketing exchange. If DigiDo is aware that the two parties had a 
money exchange after a trade, the two accounts are deleted and taken to court for “Unfair 
competition”. Clients have a right of withdrawal until 40 days. The return of delivered products 
requires extra costs.

SALE
Third-party shippers are allowed to sell low-cost hardwares on DigiDo. The sold products have to 
cost less than 80% of the new product or to be refurbished hardwares.
The delivery of sold products is fully supported by the shipper. The two parties must provide 
their real contact and address. The delivery has to be carried on in the 30 days following the 
order. Offers are saved in our database for 40 days. If a client complains about an inaccurate 
donation during this time, we reserve the right to take the shipper to court for “Offense of deception on goods”. After this delay, this is all between the shipper and the client.
In case of problems with the products or the delivery, DigiDo is never responsible.
Clients have a right of withdrawal until 40 days. The withdrawal or return costs are determined 
by the shipper’s terms and fees.
When the offer is a massive sale, we check all the products to see if they fit with their description. If not, we reserve the right to cancel every transaction.
