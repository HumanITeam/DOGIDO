                        Our HumanIT agency is made up of 14 students from multiple countries. From France, Vietnam, Morocco via Bulgaria and Lebanon, 
						we are a close-knit team. Our team is divided into 3 distinct poles: the web development pole, the design pole and the communication pole. 
						Each member of the agency puts their skills forward so that our work is as efficient as possible. 
						Our sole objective is to make DigiDo the best platform for the redistribution of used digital electronic equipment.
